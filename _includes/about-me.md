#### About Me

I started programming on my first computer, the Commodore 64, in 2000, and I have been implementing solutions in Sitecore since 2011.

I like listening to audiobooks while taking a walk. I'm interested in biology, especially the human genome, where I see parallels between the genetic code and programming languages. Additionally, I enjoy sci-fi and fantasy movies, as well as riding a bike.
