I've found a great article written by my colleague about testing with Taurus: [https://blog.intive-fdv.com/taking-jmeter-tests-to-the-next-level-with-taurus/](https://blog.intive-fdv.com/taking-jmeter-tests-to-the-next-level-with-taurus/)

I decided to set up such tests on Linux VM on Azure, and then execute them in our release pipeline and I recorded a video about it for you.
