You can create a new Sitecore helix solution in many ways:

- You can duplicate habitat repository, clean it up and use it.
- You can use [Power Shell script][powershell-script] to do that.
- You can use [Yeoman][yeoman].
- And of course, you can do it manually.

There is a nice article about [how to create it manually][article], but I decided to record a video.
